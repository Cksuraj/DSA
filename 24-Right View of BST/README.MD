Question link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/right-view-of-binary-tree/1

Given a Binary Tree, find Right view of it. Right view of a Binary Tree is set of nodes visible when tree is viewed from right side.

Right view of following tree is 1 3 7 8.

          1
       /     \
     2        3
   /   \      /    \
  4     5   6    7
    \
     8

Example 1:

Input:
       1
    /    \
   3      2

Output: 1 2

Example 2:
Input:
     10
    /   \
  20     30
 /   \
40  60 

Output: 10 30 60

- Time Complexity: O(N).
- Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree).
