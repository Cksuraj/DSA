Given a positive integer N, print count of set bits in it. 

- Example 1:
Input:

N = 6
Output:

2
Explanation:

Binary representation is '110' 
So the count of the set bit is 2.

- Example 2:

Input:

8
Output:

1
Explanation:

Binary representation is '1000' 
So the count of the set bit is 1.

- Time Complexity: O(LogN)
- Auxiliary Space: O(1)
