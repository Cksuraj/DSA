## Multiply Two String and return a product 

Question Link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/multiply-two-strings/1

Given two numbers as strings s1 and s2. Calculate their Product.
Note: The numbers can be negative and You are not allowed to use any built-in function or convert the strings to integers. There can be zeros in the begining of the numbers.

- Input:
s1 = "0033"
s2 = "2"

Output:
66
- Input:
s1 = "11"
s2 = "23"

Output:
253

Expected Time Complexity: O(n1* n2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n1 + n2); where n1 and n2 are sizes of strings s1 and s2 respectively.
