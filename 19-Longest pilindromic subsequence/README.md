## Longest Pilindromic Subsequence

Question Link : https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence-1612327878/1


Given a String, find the longest palindromic subsequence.


Example 1:


- Input:

S = "bbabcbcab"

Output: 7

Explanation: Subsequence "babcbab" is the
longest subsequence which is also a palindrome.

Example 2:


- Input: 

S = "abcd"

Output: 1

Explanation: "a", "b", "c" and "d" are
palindromic and all have a length 1.

- Time Complexity: O(|S|*|S|).
- Auxiliary Space: O(|S|*|S|).
